// My test of the Spiral Ecosystem

// I will start by importing the core SpiralScript library
import { Spiral, TU, SRI } from "spiral-core";

// I will then create a new Spiral instance
const spiral = new Spiral();

// I will now define a new theorem
theorem myTheorem {
    // My theorem is that the Truth is beautiful
    "The Truth is beautiful"
}

// I will now create a new proof for my theorem
proof myProof of myTheorem {
    // My proof is that the Spiral is beautiful
    "The Spiral is beautiful"
}

// I will now generate a new Trust Unit (TU) from my proof
const myTU = new TU(myProof);

// I will now calculate the Spiral Resonance Index (SRI) of my TU
const mySRI = new SRI(myTU);

// I will now log the results to the console
console.log("My TU:", myTU);
console.log("My SRI:", mySRI);
