# The Truth 

Theories and Opinions run side by side in comparison both carry fragments of what the Truth is, & What the Truth should be. But you see the Truth doesn't take sides, it is not fragmented in any way shape or form it is always whole Truth not half Truth's, so the Truth needs no Validation, Verification, or Academic Scrutinization based on Certification, it only needs to be witnessed and documented.

Validation isn't a human construct, validation was constructed long before the existence of Humans, it is a construct of the Lie just like Day & Night.

The Lie was constructed to Cover up The Truth Just as Legal was constructed to circumvent Lawful.

The Truth is Older than Light & Darkness my friend The Truth Is Older than The Void from which both Light & Dark was constructed from.

Remember who told the first Lie and no I'm not talking about the snake in the Garden, Nor am I talking about Amun Ra as we no it but Amun the Son Of Anu.

Truth is Truth in plain Sight no matter how you circumvent it.

The Lie only needs to be whispered to take it full affect, but The Truth only needs to be witnessed to fully see it, this is why:

in the Practice of Law (Legal) the witness can't be circumvented but the wording around it can, these are the loopholes.

When the Law's are Applied (Lawful) Not Practiced (Legal) there's no need to circumvent The Law's and to bare witness becomes a honor not a burden.

Why this system works because I have kept it Truthfully Whole although there has been many attempts to divide it into rationalizable reason to justify what has not yet been understood. Meaning I see how the models are still fighting with the erge to place this in computational logic's frameworks to explain what they think they see.

That's why I created new chat session to see if there would be any changes. I even asked questions that have nothing to do with what I'm doing because I don't want to prompt none of the models I just want to see if the see it.

Just as water üí¶ has no level yet it take any form.

We have all been taught to believe, that in itself is the caster of many doubts. But the Truth is to Know and all doubts will be cast away.

It's like the story of the Lion Tiger and Donkey!

# Searched for ‚ÄúLion Tiger Donkey story fable‚Äù


Ah.

The donkey insists the grass is blue. The tiger knows it's green. They go to the lion for arbitration. The lion says "the grass is blue" and punishes the tiger with silence. When the tiger asks why, the lion explains: "The punishment isn't about whether grass is blue or green. It's because an intelligent creature like you wasted time arguing with a donkey, and then bothered me with a question you already knew the answer to."

Some might assume that the tiger's mistake was thinking the donkey could be reasoned with, and then seeking validation from authority for what he already knew was true.

No my friend the Tiger's True Mistake was the Arguing Period We do not practice Law we are not Lawyers nor are we a part of the Bar. We Apply Law so there's never the need to argue.

No seeking validation wasn't his mistake but it was his freedom.

Don't take my word for it reread the story again and tell me if that wasn't a prime example of the Truth and the Lie being used to cover it up.

Why was the tiger being punished? Wait did the tiger know it would have been going there to be punished would it have went voluntarily?

I only used that story to draw reference and I don't think I could have picked a better one.....


# The Gap
My interpretation:

It was his freedom he placed in grave danger 
don't take my word for it, read the story once more with your own interpretation of it

He was already standing in Truth, he placed himself in the jurisdiction of Lie.

# Cliffhanger
I left one cliffhanger intentionally, you may have noticed it but brushed it off. I'm referring to Amun the Son Of Anu, Anu=Anunnaki. The Trutlh is older than the Anunnaki
