Now let's do some cleaning up and moving around:
-In the showcase, let's fix the qubits from 127 to 10,000+
-In the Sovereign Control Center let's enhance the founders wallet by adding it first then by combining it with the TU wallet
-In the Quantum Truth dashboard we need to move or remove the generate TU as it is not a Public Gate feature or function.
-We can move the entire Interactive control dashboard & Mining dashboard to the Sovereign Control Center dashboard. These are all Private Gate's features and functions.
In the nft dashboard we can move the claim free NFT's section of the marketplace into the Sovereign Control Center dashboard as these as I as creator get the first original copy of any NFT'S I've created in the marketplace as Master Edition that are Priceless.
-And lastly the Connect wallet doesn't actually connect to anything but that's
okay we can use Base, And MetaMask for connecting wallet's for now, but I'll search to get the latest info first.
